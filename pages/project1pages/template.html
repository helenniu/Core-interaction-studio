		<!-- Research question -->
		<div class='content' id='one'>
			<h1>Research question</h1>
			<p>How can environmental activism be more accessible and be more effective in creating change and participation?
				<h2>I think I’m interested in this because I feel like environmental activism has become a very influential topic and movement currently. I think the impact of more radical activism such as strikes or fasting have large unseen effects socially and could be more inclusive to all ages, races, classes. The organization of activities could be more standardized to allow for greater involvement. For me I do want to participate in climate activism, but I don’t think choosing to miss classes that I pay for is the best way for me to participate. I think there should be many more ways to be socially involved in creating change.

			<h2>issues with the privalege of being an activist</h2>
			<h2>extreme contribution vs. everyday small contributions</h2>
			<h2>inclusivity through digital sharing, access to information to all ages, backgrounds</h2>
			<h2>greater feeling of contributing locally, and making local change because things like marches and green products intend to effect larger change but aren't very visible or motivating</h2>
